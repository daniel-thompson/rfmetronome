Red Feline Metronome
====================

Red Feline Metronome is a simple metronome program for Android.  This
program is free software licensed under the GNU General Public License
(version 3 or later).

This was written mostly to get familar with the Android APIs tools. As
such the only thing that distinguishes this program from the many, many
similar programs available for Android is the use of a simple
synthesizer to generate its clicks (rather than using pre-rendered
samples). It generates a continous audio streams in order to offer a
steady tick rate.

This program cannot currently be found on Google Play. The primary
reason for this is that there is no visual click indicator and
therefore, whilst the program is functional, I nevertheless regard it
as unfinished.
